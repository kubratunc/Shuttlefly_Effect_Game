# Shuttlefly_Effect_Game

This project is made for Yildiz Technical University Computer Engineering Midterm Project. Collaborated with [Ali Emre Nebiler](https://github.com/aliemrenebiler). 

To summarize briefly, it is a 2D storytelling game. There are three characters which is chosen by the user. After the creation of
the characters, the rest of the game continues with different events happening and choices.

The project was developed with Flutter. It is designed for Android, IOS and Web. Firebase is used as the database.

How To Play?

The game starts with character selection after the story. The player chooses 3 of the surviving astronauts in his own way. The feature that is critical in character selection is the character's ability. Certain skill combinations provide special advantages in character selection. In addition, each skill causes different results in the choices in the game.

After the character selection, the main game part begins, where the events are constantly happening. In the face of incoming events, the player chooses one of the 3 characters or passes the event. As a result of each choice made, a different result is obtained, and the 4 states of the 3 characters (health, oxygen, mental level and energy) are positively/negatively affected by this choice. If any state hits zero, the game ends.

Mostly inspired from Reigns (a mobile decision game).
